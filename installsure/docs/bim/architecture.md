# BIM Service Architecture (MIT â€” Self-Updating BIM)

## Overview

Based on MIT Fuller (2009) thesis: "A simplified software architecture for self-updating BIM"

This architecture implements a modular, programmatic update pipeline for object-based 3D models with explicit semantic relationships.

## Modules (Must Exist)

### 1. Ingest Module

**Purpose**: Detect & receive BIM payloads (IFC/Revit exports)

**Responsibilities**:

- Monitor file system for new IFC files
- Validate incoming BIM file formats
- Extract metadata and provenance information
- Queue files for processing
- Handle file upload via API endpoints

**Interfaces**:

- File system watchers
- HTTP upload endpoints
- Message queue integration
- Validation service calls

### 2. Normalize Module

**Purpose**: Harmonize units, coordinate systems, IDs; maintain canonical object store

**Responsibilities**:

- Convert between coordinate reference systems
- Normalize units of measurement
- Standardize object IDs and GUIDs
- Maintain canonical object representation
- Resolve naming conflicts

**Interfaces**:

- Coordinate transformation services
- Unit conversion libraries
- ID generation services
- Object store management

### 3. Update Module

**Purpose**: Apply diffs to object-based 3D model; preserve invariants; log provenance

**Responsibilities**:

- Apply incremental changes to BIM models
- Preserve representation invariants
- Log all changes with provenance
- Validate model consistency
- Handle conflict resolution

**Interfaces**:

- Change tracking services
- Invariant validation
- Provenance logging
- Conflict resolution algorithms

### 4. Publish Module

**Purpose**: Export views (IFC, CityGML, lightweight web formats) + indices for search

**Responsibilities**:

- Generate IFC exports
- Create CityGML representations
- Produce web-optimized formats
- Build search indices
- Manage export caching

**Interfaces**:

- IFC export services
- CityGML conversion
- Web format generation
- Search index management

## Design Notes

### Object-Based Model

- Explicit semantic relationships between BIM objects
- Changes propagate programmatically through dependency graphs
- Immutable object states after completion
- Version-controlled object history

### Module Contracts

- All module interfaces are formally specified
- Input/output schemas are validated
- Error handling is standardized
- Performance metrics are collected

### Provenance Tracking

- Every change emits a provenance record
- Change history is immutable
- Audit trail is complete and verifiable
- Rollback capabilities are supported

### Invariant Preservation

- All changes must preserve representation invariants
- Model consistency is validated after each update
- Failed updates are rolled back automatically
- Invariant violations are logged and reported

## Implementation Requirements

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Framework**: FastAPI for API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for object storage
- **Message Queue**: Redis for job processing
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible storage
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

### Security Requirements

- All file uploads are scanned for malware
- Access to BIM data is role-based
- All operations are logged and audited
- Data is encrypted at rest and in transit

### Performance Requirements

- File processing within 30 seconds for files < 100MB
- Concurrent processing of up to 10 files
- 99.9% uptime for API endpoints
- Sub-second response times for metadata queries

### Compliance Requirements

- IFC 4.3 specification compliance
- CityGML 3.0 specification compliance
- ISO 19650 information management standards
- GDPR compliance for EU data processing
